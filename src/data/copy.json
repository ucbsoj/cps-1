She likes going to parks, calling her grandma on the phone. Her mom and dad were married for over 5 years but mutually agreed to separate. They did not plan to have Susie, but try their best to raise her. Susie stays with her mom because her dad is living at home with his parents. He does make a lot of money but tries to support his family. Carol suffers from untreated post partum depression. She tried her best to hide it from her family but the pain killers from her delivery have run out. She had a history of substance abuse and had been sober during Susie's pregnancy, but she lapsed for a few days.
